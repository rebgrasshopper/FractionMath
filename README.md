## Introduction:

### This coding challenge is intended to meet the following requirements:

1. Write a command-line program in the language of your choice that will take operations on fractions as an input and produce a fractional result.

2. Legal operators shall be *,/,+,- (multiply, divide, add, subtract).

3. Operands and operators shall be separated by one or more spaces.

5. Mixed numbers will be represented by whole_numerator/denominator (e.g. 3_1/4)

6. Improper fractions and whole numbers are also allowed as operands.




## Installation:

Download files from GitHub or clone repository. Python 3 is required.

## Usage:

To run program, use command line to run ```python fractionMath.py```

You may enter fraction operations formatted as seen below, or you may use the commands ```help``` or ```exit```.

## Example Run:

? 1/2 * 3_3/4

= 1_7/8

? 2_3/8 + 9/8

= 3_1/2

## License:

GNU General Public License v3.0

## Tests:

To run tests, use command line to run ```python test_fractionMath.py```

## Future:

As additional functionality, I would ideally add the ability to process queries with multiple operators, but in the interest of not adding uneccesary complication, for now I am fulfilling the requirements as laid out.
